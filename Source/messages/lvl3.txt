Level 3: Bug Hunt
Oh no! You've encountered a bug that prevents you from escaping this level! In Linux, you can remove files using the rm command.

To remove the bug and proceed, use the command:

rm [BUG_NAME]

Eliminate the bug to clear your path and continue your escape. Can you fix the system and make it out alive?

Good luck, brave adventurer!
