Level 1: Welcome to Linux World
Welcome to the Linux World! You've been kidnapped and find yourself trapped in a labyrinth of directories. 
To escape and win the game, you must navigate through this maze and find the goal directory. But beware! 
There's a monster lurking in the system. If you end up in the same directory as the monster, you will lose.

In this game, you will use Linux commands to move between directories. 
Use the command prompt located at the bottom left of your screen to type commands.

To move from your current directory to a subdirectory, use the command:
cd [DIRECTORY_NAME]

Can you find your way to freedom without encountering the monster? Let's start moving and win this game!
