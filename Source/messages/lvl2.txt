Level 2: Finding Hidden Directories
In the Linux system, you can use the ls command to list the contents of the current directory. 
This will show you all files and directories within it.
There is a directory whose name you don't know, and to move to it, you'll need to discover its name first. 
Navigate to the directory right before the unknown one, and use the ls command to reveal its name:
ls

Use your newly acquired knowledge to find and reach the hidden directory. Good luck!
